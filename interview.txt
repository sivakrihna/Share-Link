-->diff b/w df and du
du == Disk Usage. It walks through directory tree and counts the sum size of all files therein. 
      It may not output exact information due to the possibility of unreadable files, hardlinks in directory tree, etc. 
      It will show information about the specific directory requested. Think, "How much disk space is being used by these files?"
df == Disk Free. Looks at disk used blocks directly in filesystem metadata. 
      Because of this it returns much faster that du but can only show info about the entire disk/partition. 
      Think, "How much free disk space do I have?"
-->ulimit
   On Linux, when a process opens a file, the OS will check the max opened files limitation.
   sudo ulimit -n 40000
			(or)
   edited "/etc/sysctl.conf" and put fs.file-max=40000. I've also edited /etc/security/limits.conf and updated hard and soft values,
   Added following lines in /etc/security/limits.conf -

*     soft    nofile          40000
*     hard    nofile          40000

   SHRshared mem) memory that can potentially be used bu other processes
