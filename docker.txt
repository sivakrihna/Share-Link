-->docker is a light weight dauetg
-->it isa portable
-->vietual machines are over head..it reduce the system performence of the system...where as docker containers are light weight...we can run many operating systems on same hardware..
-->they are portable because they donot use the volume..where as vms are taking large volume of storage it is difficult to move.

-->build once,configure once,run anyware...
-->docker client is the user interface that allows communication between the users and and thedocker daemon.
-->docker deamon sits on the client machine and answering the requests services.
-->docker index is a centralised registry allowing backup of docker container images and private access permissions.

-->docker containers are actual containers running the applications and includes the operating systems,user addedfiles and meta data.
-->docker images are all inclusive images that help launch docker containers.
-->docker file is a file containing instructions that help automate image creation.
-->layer:each file system that is stacked when docker mounts rootfs.

-->to install docker...[sudo rpm install docker]
-->basic docker commands:
   --docker pull==pull a pre-built image from the public repos.
   --docker run===run the container in one of three nodes:background,foreground,interactivd.
   --docker logs==view the logs of running jobs.
   --docker commit==save the container state as an image.
   --docker images==obtain the list of all images.
  --docker diff==list of changes in files and directories.
  --docker build==build docker imageds from docker files.
  --docker inspect==low level information about containers and images.
  --docker attach==interact with running docker containers.
  --docker kill==kill the main process of the docker container

-->dockerfile
   syntax:instruction argument
-->dockerfile commands:
   --maintainer <authorname> :set a name for author feild for the image.
   --run<command> :execute a command in a shell.
   --add <src><dest>:copy files from one location to other.
   --cmd<executable,parm1,parm2>:provides defaults for an excuting container.
   --expose<port> :ports on which container litstens to.
   --entrypoint<executable,parm1,parm2>:configure a container as executable.
   --workdia path/to/workdir:set working dorectory
   --env<key><value>:set environment variables.
   --user<uid>:set userid for use images
   --volume['/data']:enable accesstoa directory from working container.


--sudo docker run ubuntu12.16 ls[to download ubuntu image and  run]
--sudo time docker run ubuntu12.16 ls[it gives the time when the docker start and stop]
--sudo docker ps -a[it gives the all the containers which are running or not.it give all containers list where as "sudo docker ps"it gives only running containers]
--sudo docker run ubuntu12.16 sleeep 10[it sleeps for ten seconds]
--sudo docker run -d ubuntu12.16 sleeep 10[it runs the container in foreground mode,after running this if we check "docker ps" it gives the container in list]
--sudo docker run -i ubuntu12.16 bash[this is called interactive mode,we can run our ubuntu commands in container like ls,cd,cp....]
--after commit the docker run "sudo docker inspect 'dockername' is gives us whole information about container..it is mainly used to know ip of container]
